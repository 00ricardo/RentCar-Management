MCV - Model View Controller 
Model - Connect to DB and get the data 
View - The front end 
Controller - The connection between Models and Views, (application logic = visiting routes we get different data)



0 - Create Enviroment
    0.1 - npx create-react-app frontend 
    0.2 - clean default react configuration
    0.3 - move gitignore from frontend to global
    0.4 - in gitignore update node_modules and add node_modules/
    0.5 - in gitignore add .env 
    0.6 - in package.json add the scripts to run server and react (concurrently)
1 - Create Components
    1.1 - folder components (header, footer, products)
    1.2 - folder screens (home screen, product screen)
    1.3 - implement react router (link to...)
2 - Create Server
    2.1 - folder config (config database)
    2.2 - file env 
    2.3 folder routes (router with routes)
    2.3.1 folder controllers (the return we want when we visit a specific route )
    2.4 folder handleErrors (handle errors)
    2.5 folder DBModels (DB schema and create models)
3 - Fetching Data from DB
    3.1 - implement axios in screens with requests to backend (need to config proxy in frontend to the backend) -----> substituido por redux 
    3.2  config App to show the screen accordantly with react-router-dom 
4 - Implement Redux (States and Actions Components)
    4.1 - create store.js (basically it grabs all the reducers and get the actual data -> its the "store" where we get stuff and then manipulate it, in this context, our data from DB)
    4.2 - folder actions (implement axios with redux, basically it will allows us dispatch the actions that we want accordantly and define the payload we want in each action) 
    4.3 - folder reducers (switch with all the actions and the outcome -> return state and payload)
